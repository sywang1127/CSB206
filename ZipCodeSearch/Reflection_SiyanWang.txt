\f1 This code is much more complicated than the code we wrote before. It relates to two classes and several methods. I think to write a structural tree before writing the code is very helpful. It can help me know what methods and what classes are necessary to include in my codes. At the same time, I feel it is very necessary to click \'93tap\'94 for each line so that the structure will be clearer. Also, think as many situations as possible is important. At first, I input \'93 19041\'94(with a space before 1) and I found it is not ok to get an output. Hence, I add a trim sentence to solve this problem and it is proved to work.
